# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

In the present world, one of the major problem is credit card fraud detection. The importance of detecting fraudulent activities during transactions have been a big trouble for the credit card companies. It costs individuals and financial institutions billions of dollars annually. This project demonstrates various algorithms we can use to detect the fraudulent transactions. Today, we have many machine learning algorithms that can help us classify abnormal transactions. The only requirement is the past data and the precise machine learning algorithm.
